This is "Connector", a sort of visual debugging or data browsing tool for
the Verse network platform.

Connector was written by Eskil Steenberg.

The Verse homepage is at <http://www.blender.org/modules/verse/>, and the
project page at Blender, where you can find out how to access the code in
CVS, is at <http://projects.blender.org/projects/verse/>.
